### Institution
* Institutions can log in, and on their profile page, create new events.
* In the form, they can add all the details of the event and specify what skills they‚Äôre looking for. 
* Using Cloudinary API, the institution can change the default event picture.

### Volunteer
* After the volunteer creates an account and logs in, they can change their picture, choose up to 3 skills, and start looking for opportunities.
* For the Recommended Events feature, volunteers are matched with opportunities based on their individual skills and by their location. To implement this, I had to create 2 new many-to-many relationships in my database, so I could find the events that matched the skills selected by the volunteer. And using Geopy, I could locate the coordinates of the event and the volunteer to match them by the city.

* The volunteer can also search for opportunities by the city, state and what cause they are most interested in. I used a fetch request to get the search results from the database using an SQLAlchemy query, and the results are displayed on the page using React.

* In the event‚Äôs page, I used GoogleMaps API to render the event‚Äôs location.
 
* Users can also click on the institution page to see other events they might be interested in, as well as leave a comment and rate their experience with that institution, a feature that was implemented using AJAX.
